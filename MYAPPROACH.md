MY APPROACH
The first step in ensuring delivered high-quality, reliable and stable software is to make
manual API testing with Postman
If there is a swagger document, I practice with Swagger Documents to understand which endpoints are available, which variables can I utilise
If there are no documents, I practice manual API testing from Dev Tool(Network) and Postman.
